# Vim configuration file

## Plugins

The following are plugins that have been hardcoded with no issues:
- jiangmiao/auto-pairs
- tpope/vim-pathogen
- tpope/vim-surround

The following are plugins that have not been hardcoded, and therefore require manual installation into the "bundle" directory:
- ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim
- donaldttt/fuzzyy (doesn't work on iVim)
- vim-airline/vim-airline
- vimwiki/vimwiki

## Themes

The following are themes that have been hardcoded with no issues:
- connorholyday/vim-snazzy
- itsjunetime/rose-pine-vim
- NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme
- raphamorim/lucario
- rose-pine/vim

The following are themes that have been hardcoded, despite having airline themes in their "autoload" directories:
- artanikin/vim-synthwave84
- ayu-theme/ayu-vim
- ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim
- lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8
- morhetz/gruvbox
- thedenisnikulin/vim-cyberpunk

The following themes only work properly when installed to the "bundle" directory:
