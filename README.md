# Vim configuration file

The following are plugins that have been hardcoded:
- tpope/vim-pathogen
- tpope/vim-surround

The following are plugins that have not been hardcoded, and therefore require manual installation into the "bundle" directory:
- ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim
- donaldttt/fuzzyy (doesn't work on iVim)
- vim-airline/vim-airline
- vimwiki/vimwiki

The same is true for theme packages. The themes that have been hardcoded, unless specified, are those composed of only a single file.

The following are plugins that have been hardcoded:
- connorholyday/vim-snazzy
- itsjunetime/rose-pine-vim
- NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme
- raphamorim/lucario
- rose-pine/vim

The following are plugins that have been hardcoded, despite having airline themes in the "autoload" directory:
- artanikin/vim-synthwave84
- ayu-theme/ayu-vim
- ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim
- joshdick/onedark.vim
- lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8
- morhetz/gruvbox
- sainnhe/gruvbox-material
- thedenisnikulin/vim-cyberpunk

Potentially, the themes with more than 1 file can also be added to the "bundle" directory.
