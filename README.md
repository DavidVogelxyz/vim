# Vim configurations

A vimrc for Vim.

This is for servers, where it often doesn't make sense to install `neovim`.

An example of this is on Debian servers. Because the Debian repo has an old version of `neovim`, getting an up-to-date version requires downloading 200+ MBs of data. In addition, building `neovim` from source takes a bit of time. Using `vim` in this case is a preferable solution.
